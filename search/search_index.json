About model \uf0c1 SMODERP is a hydrological model designed to simulate soil erosion and surface runoff processes in small catchments or fields. Its primary focus is on predicting the impact of extrem rainfall on generation of surface runoff and cosequence erison process. The model takes into various factors such as soil properties, land use, vegetation cover, and topography to accurately predict surface water flow, risk of rill erosion and discharge from extrem event in small watter bodies. SMODERP can be used for several applications, including: Evaluation of conservation practices : The model can evaluate the effectiveness of soil and water conservation measures (such contour farming, managemen of cover crops, design of erosion control measure) in reducing of direct runff an rill soil erosion. Assessment of soil erosion risk : By simulating the erosion process under different rainfall events and land management practices, SMODERP helps in identifying areas at risk of rill erosion. Water resources management : By estimating surface runoff, SMODERP assists in water resources planning and management, including the design of conservation ditches systems and the assessment of flood risks. Land use planning : The model can inform land use planning decisions by predicting the impact of different land use scenarios on soil erosion and runoff. SMODERP is characterized by its flexibility and adaptability to various scales and conditions, making it suitable for both research and practical applications in environmental and agricultural settings. Its development and updates are typically the result of collaborative efforts among research institutions, universities, and environmental agencies, aiming to improve its accuracy, user-friendliness, and applicability to a wide range of environmental and hydrological issues. Users \uf0c1 The SMODERP hydrological model is utilized by a diverse group of professionals and researchers involved in environmental science, hydrology, land management, and related fields. Civil and enviromental engineers, particularly those in water resources engineering, stormwater management, and erosion control, use SMODERP for designing effective drainage systems, retention basins, and other infrastructure to manage runoff and mitigate erosion risks. Among its users are hydrologists who study the movement of surface watter from rainfall extrems. SMODERP can be used to predict surface runoff and soil erosion in response to various hydrological events. Environmental scientists, focusing on addressing environmental problems such as soil erosion, water pollution, and habitat destruction, employ the model to evaluate the impacts of land use changes and conservation practices. Conservationists and non-governmental organizations focused on conservation efforts and environmental protection utilize SMODERP to identify areas at risk, promote sustainable land management practices, and evaluate the success of conservation initiatives. Lastly, academics and students in environmental science, hydrology, agricultural science, and related disciplines use the model for educational purposes, research projects, and to deepen their understanding of hydrological processes and the dynamics of soil erosion.

Maximum time step \uf0c1 The time step \u0394t is adjusted during the calculation according Courant\u2013Friedrichs\u2013Lewy condition to maintain numerical stability. The length of the time step depends on the surface runoff velocity and the spatial step size (DMT cell size). Therefore a maximum time step needs to be set. The maximum time step depends on the desired detail of the output data, especially during a precipitation episode when flow velocities are already lower and when the stability criterion would allow too large a time step. The implementation of the numerical stability are described in reference manual . The maxim time step is also user as the initial time step in the calculation. Total runnig time \uf0c1 The total simulation time refers to the duration over which the model performs its computations. To calculate the overall runoff volume accurately, the simulation duration must extend beyond the period of the simulated rainfall event. Conversely, to determine the peak flow rate, the simulation time may be shorter than the precipitation duration. Output directory \uf0c1 This specifies the location where the results will be stored. Note that this folder may be overwritten. Extra output \uf0c1 If the extra outputs are check, temp and control data will be saved in output folder. Description of extra output these parameters described in the reference manual . Computation settings \uf0c1 Flow direction \uf0c1 Flow direction algorithm controls to which computational cell or cells the water flows i.e. it controls the flow routing. Two options are implemented in SMODERP2D: D8 a single direction flow algorithm and multiple flow direction algorithm (MFD) (Seibert, 2013). If D8 is set, all of the sheet flow volume from a cell flows to single adjacent cell with highest elevation difference. If MFD is set, the sheet flow volume from a cell is divided proportionally to multiple downslope cells based on elevation difference between cells. note : If MDF is set, the rill flow still uses the D8 flow direction algorithm since the rill is essentially small channel that can only flow in on direction. In watercourse network, the water from the surface flow is further conducted through a network based on the topology of the network. Shallow water flow equation approximation \uf0c1 The model is capable of using kinematic and diffusive wave approximation of Saint-Venant equations. Kinematic wave approximation assumes that the slope of the water level is parallel to the slope of the soil surface. This approximation is valid for step slopes where substantial backwater effect does not occur. The diffusive wave is driven be the waster surface slope. Therefore, the backwater effect is considered. The diffusive wave approximation should be used if flat areas as presented in the model. However, the diffusive wave is computationally more intensive compared to kinematic wave approximation. For more details about the flow equation approximation see the reference manual . Time derivative approximation \uf0c1 The SMODERP2D calculated the transient water flow. Therefore, the time derivation takes place in the equation. To solve the time approach of the solution this derivative has to be solved. Ordinary explicit and implicit Euler methods are implemented in SMODERP2D to solve the time derivative. Essentially, the explicit method is usually more sensitive to time step length. In some cases this can cause slow down in the computation due to extremely small time step. The implicit generally allows the model to run with larger time step (depends on the model setting). However, a system of linear equations need to be constructed and solved. Usually, the advantages of implicit method are pronounced for computation of larger areas (>1,000,000 cells in raster). For smaller areas (<1,000 cells in raster) the computation time to construct and solve the system of linear equations slows down the computation and explicit method may lead to shorter computational time, especially for larger raster cell size (>5 m). No general recommendation to which method to use can be given. It is recommended to test both methods for each specific model, if necessary.
