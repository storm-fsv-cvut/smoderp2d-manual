Rainfall simulation experiments are widely used as a standard method to study various flow and transport processes induced by rainfall. They have been used on different slopes, scales, soils and vegetation cover  \cite{Otero2011, Davidova2016}, etc. Surface runoff rate and sediment yield are standard variables observed in experiments oriented on soil erosion research with use of rainfall simulators. The review of simulators used across Europe provides (Iserloh, 2013). Due to the nature of the device the small simulators with watered area around 1 m2 are more frequent. Larger simulators can be found as well, as described for example in \cite{Sanguesa2010}, \cite{Strauss2000} \cite{Marques2007},  \citep{EGUDS}.
