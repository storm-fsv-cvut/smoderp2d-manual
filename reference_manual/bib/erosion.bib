abstract = {Provides a unique and comprehensive assessment of soil erosion throughout Europe, an important aspect to control and manage if landscapes are to be sustained for the future. Written in two parts, Soil Erosion in Europe primarily focuses on current issues, area specific soil erosion rates, on and off-site impacts, government responses, soil conservation measures, and soil erosion risk maps.

@article{Marques2007,
abstract = {The erosive power of frequent light rainfalls is studied in this paper. Field experiments of simulated rainfall (Intensity, 21 mm h(-1) and kinetic energy, 13.5 J m(-2) mm(-1)) were conducted over 8 bounded USLE plots (80 m(2) each) with a slope of 10{\%}. In 4 plots the soil was almost bare ({\textless}4{\%} vegetation cover); the other 4 plots had almost full cover with natural vegetation in one year. Runoff and sediment yield was recorded. The results revealed the efficiency of vegetation cover reducing runoff and sediments. Runoff and sediments were negligible in covered plots. Therefore, in bare plots, although sediment yield was generally low, averaging 74+/-43 kg ha(-1), the mean of runoff achieved a coefficient of 35{\%}, this magnitude has to be taken into consideration in this region verging on aridity. Rains around 13.5 J m(-2) mm(-1) of kinetic energy are quite frequent in the study area (34{\%} of recorded rains en 12 years). If we would consider the usual lower limits from the literature, we would be ignoring an important percent of natural rainfall episodes.},

@article{Schindewolf2012a,
abstract = {The specific parameters of soil erosion models as resistance to erosion, hydraulic roughness etc., are usually determined by simulated rainfall experiments. Due to the required plot length of usually 22. m, these experiments can only be carried out with an enormous effort of time and manpower. This study presents a runoff feeding device, which is able to multiply the plot length virtually by supplying sediment loaded runoff from upstream. Thus it is possible to restrict the plot length to 3. m and nevertheless simulate flow conditions similar to those using standard plots. The described method has been already tested successfully under laboratory conditions (Parson et al., 1998; R{\"{o}}mkens et al., 2001; Schmidt, 1996). In the present study, this method is used to determine input parameters for the soil loss and deposition model EROSION 2D/3D under field conditions. Based on the model parameters "skinfactor, soil resistance to erosion and surface roughness" the experimental approach is described exemplarily. The experimental results show that results from large-scale rainfall simulations with the plot's length of 22. m can be reproduced successfully. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},
