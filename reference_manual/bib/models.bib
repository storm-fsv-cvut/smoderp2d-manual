abstract = {Catchment resources, generated from multi-source data (remotely-sensed, map- and ground-based systems), were input to a raster-based Geographical Information Systems (GIS) after geometrically co-registered to a standard grid (pixel). The GIS used was the PC-based, indigenously-developed package, called GRAM (Geo-Referenced Area Management). A set of knowledge-based rules, for assessing the soil erosion of this heterogeneous hilly catchment, were formulated from the knowledge of the multi-disciplinary resource-experts and the knowledge of the local catchment resources, in addition to the field observations. This rule-based model, which is hopefully fast and cost-effective and without effect of the individual bias, helped in inferring the erosion intensity units that most likely to occur at any given pixel in the system. Finally, the catchment was grouped into four different erosion intensity units namely very severe, severe, moderate to severe and slight to moderate. The quantitative soil loss (t ha-1 year-1) ranges, estimated by USLE model by a spatial information analysis approach (GIS), were also computed: (a) Very severe ({\textgreater} 50): (b) Severe (40-50); (c) Moderate to severe (20-40); and (d) Slight to moderate ({\textless} 20). An integrated priority delineation survey, for taking up soil/water conservation measures by Sediment Yield Index model, carried out in the catchment grouped the catchment into very high, high, medium and low priority classes. Apparently, the areal extent of high and moderate priority classes occupy about 80{\%} of the catchment, which is closely following the areal extent of severe and moderate to severe erosion intensity unit categories by this rule-based model. The outcome of the results of this study will be immensely useful to monitor the dynamic changes in the catchment environment. The soil erosion information system thus generated, identifies the targeted problem areas for conservation planning and sustainable development of the catchment. Although it is an early airing of results obtained from this rule-based model, the introduction of multi-disciplinary expert's informed opinion may provide an extension to the traditional methods of assessing the soil erosion status/magnitude which should enable and/or evaluate different catchment management scenarios.},

abstract = {Soil erosion models have advanced in recent years, by becoming more physically-based, with better representation of spatial patterns. Despite substantial progress, fundamental difficulties in catchment scale applications have been widely reported. In this paper, we introduce a new catchment scale soil erosion model. The model is designed for catchment interface and management purposes by: (1) using relatively common input data; (2) having a modular model structure; and (3) a clear and easily interpretable output analysis, by producing possibility or potential, rather than quantitative erosion maps. The model (named: FuDSEM; fuzzy-based dynamic soil erosion model) is spatially explicit and temporally dynamic and is formalized and based on fuzzy-logic equations. FuDSEM was initially evaluated on a small data-rich catchment and was found well calibrated. It was then implemented on a medium-sized heterogeneous catchment in central Israel. Initial evaluations of the medium-scale model predictions were conducted by: (1) comparison of FuDSEM runoff predictions against measured runoff from five hydrological stations and (2) a site specific evaluation of the FuDSEM multi-year erosion prediction in two sub-catchments. FuDSEM was compared with two other erosion models (a temporally static version of itself and a known physically-based model). The results show the advantages of FuDSEM over the other two models in evaluating the relative distribution of erosion, thereby emphasizing the benefits of its temporally dynamic and fuzzy structure. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Predictions from hydrologic and erosion models contain a large degree of uncertainty. The Modified Point Estimate Method (Harr, 1989) used in conjunction with a response surface exploration technique (Brooks, 1958) provides a simple, computationally efficient, and powerful tool for evaluating uncertainty of predictions by natural-resource models. The method allows analysis of models with a large number of input parameters which may be correlated and for which the exact input parameter distribution is unknown. The method was applied to the Water Erosion Prediction Project single rainfall-event erosion model. Sixty treatment combinations were selected to determine WEPP output uncertainties for a wide range of soil, crop, management, topographic, and storm conditions. The levels of the treatment combinations were randomly selected to span the entire factorial space of the 28 WEPP inputs, but with a finite number of treatment combinations. Five WEPP outputs were studied: peak runoff rate, average soil loss, average deposition, sediment yield, and sediment specific surface enrichment ratio. Maximum and average output uncertainties, given by the coefficient of variation, were determined for each output of the 60 treatments. Maximum coefficients of variation for peak runoff rate, soil loss, sediment yield, and sediment enrichment ratio were 196, 267, 323, and 47{\%}, respectively. Average coefficients of variation for the same set of variables were 65, 99, 106, and 13{\%}, respectively. Coefficient of variation was less for larger runoff and erosion events, which account for a large percentage of the total soil loss at a location over extended time periods. Significant, positive correlations existed between the coefficients of variation of peak runoff average soil loss, and average soil loss and sediment yield, indicating that the uncertainty in average soil loss and in sediment yield may be directly related to the uncertainty in peak runoff rate.},

A simple interrill soil water transport model is applied to a laboratory catchment to investigate the application of raindrop detachment and transport in interrill areas explicitly. A controlled laboratory rainfall simulation study with slope length simulation by flow addition was used to assess the raindrop detachment and transport of detached soil by overland flow in interrill areas. Artificial rainfall of moderate to high intensity was used to simulate intense rain storms. However, experiments were restricted to conditions where rilling and channelling did not occur and where overland flow covered most of the surface. A simple equation with a rainfall intensity term for raindrop detachment, and a simple sediment transport equation with unit discharge and a slope term were found to be applicable to the situation where clear water is added at the upper end of a small plot to simulate increased slope length. The proposed generic relationships can be used to predict raindrop detachment and the sediment transport capacity of interrill flow and can therefore contribute to the development of physically-based erosion models.

abstract = {A plenty of models exist for study of the soil erosion and sediment yield processes. However, these models vary significantly in terms of their capability and complexity, input requirements, representation of processes, spatial and temporal scale accountability, practical applicability, and types of output they provide. The present study reviews 50 physically based soil erosion and sediment yield models with respect to these factors including shortcomings and strengths. The literature generally suggests the use of models like SWAT, WEPP, AGNPS, ANSWERS and SHETRAN for soil erosion and sediment studies. Most of the developed soil erosion and sediment yield models are capable of simulating soil detachment and sediment delivery processes at hillslope scale; a limited development was found in the field of reservoir siltation and channel erosion processes. The study proposes a guideline for selection of an appropriate model to the reader for a given application or case study. The future research suggested to improve the simulation and prediction capability of physically based soil erosion and sediment yield models, and should focus on incorporation of improved global web based weather database, inclusion of sediment associated water quality and gully erosion simulation module, and improvement in reservoir siltation and channel erosion simulation processes.},
