abstract = {The contribution presents a comparison of a surface runoff simulated by profile method (1D) and spatially distributed method (2D). Simulation model SMODERP is used for calculation and prediction of soil erosion and surface runoff from agricultural land. This physically based model that includes the processes of infiltration (Phillips equation), surface runoff (kinematic wave based equation), and surface retention. Surface roughness and vegetation are impacted runoff. 1D model was developed in past, new 2D model was developed in the last two years. The model is being developed at the Department of Irrigation, Drainage and Landscape Engineering, Civil Engineering Faculty, CTU in Prague. The physical relations were implemented through the Python script to 2D model. This script was developed as a tool for widespread GIS software ArcGIS. This script uses ArcGIS system tools for raster and vectors treatment of the inputs. Flow direction is calculated by Steepest Descent algorithm in the preliminary version of 2D model. Numerical stability of the model is solved by Courant criterion. Spatial scale is fixed. Time step is dynamically changed depending on how flow is generated and developed. Surface runoff is described by modification of the kinematic wave equation. Special parameters for five different soil textures were calibrated on the set of forty measurements performed on the laboratory rainfall simulator and validated at field measurement. Spatially distributed models enable to estimate not only surface runoff but also creation of the rills and flow in these rills. Concentrated surface runoff is described in the model by kinematic wave equation. Equation uses Manning roughness coefficient for surface runoff. For modelling of the rills a specific sub model was created. This sub model uses Manning formula for flow estimation. SMODERP is meant to be used not only for the research purposes, but mainly for the engineering practice. We also present how the input data can be obtained based on available resources (soil maps and data, land use, terrain models, field research, etc.) and how can the model be used in the assessments of soil erosion risk and in designing of erosion control measures. {\textcopyright} SGEM2013 All Rights Reserved by the International Multidisciplinary Scientific GeoConference SGEM.},
