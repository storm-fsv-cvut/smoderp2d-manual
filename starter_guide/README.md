###  SMODERP2D - Distributed event-based model for surface and subsurface runoff and erosion  ### 

Welcome to the starter guide for the SMODERP2D model. The aim of this text is
to provide basic information to users on how to run the SMODERP2D model.

This model was designed to calculate hydrological and erosion processes on
individual plots or small catchments. The outputs of the model are primarily
used to determine runoff conditions in a catchment and obtain parameters for
runoff and erosion risk protection measures on agricultural land. Additionally,
the model can assist in designing more complex systems, including sediment
retention ponds, dry basins, or polders.  Its use complies with current
methods, technical standards, and recommended practices.
