abstract = {The contribution presents a comparison of a surface runoff simulated by profile method (1D) and spatially distributed method (2D). Simulation model SMODERP is used for calculation and prediction of soil erosion and surface runoff from agricultural land. This physically based model that includes the processes of infiltration (Phillips equation), surface runoff (kinematic wave based equation), and surface retention. Surface roughness and vegetation are impacted runoff. 1D model was developed in past, new 2D model was developed in the last two years. The model is being developed at the Department of Irrigation, Drainage and Landscape Engineering, Civil Engineering Faculty, CTU in Prague. The physical relations were implemented through the Python script to 2D model. This script was developed as a tool for widespread GIS software ArcGIS. This script uses ArcGIS system tools for raster and vectors treatment of the inputs. Flow direction is calculated by Steepest Descent algorithm in the preliminary version of 2D model. Numerical stability of the model is solved by Courant criterion. Spatial scale is fixed. Time step is dynamically changed depending on how flow is generated and developed. Surface runoff is described by modification of the kinematic wave equation. Special parameters for five different soil textures were calibrated on the set of forty measurements performed on the laboratory rainfall simulator and validated at field measurement. Spatially distributed models enable to estimate not only surface runoff but also creation of the rills and flow in these rills. Concentrated surface runoff is described in the model by kinematic wave equation. Equation uses Manning roughness coefficient for surface runoff. For modelling of the rills a specific sub model was created. This sub model uses Manning formula for flow estimation. SMODERP is meant to be used not only for the research purposes, but mainly for the engineering practice. We also present how the input data can be obtained based on available resources (soil maps and data, land use, terrain models, field research, etc.) and how can the model be used in the assessments of soil erosion risk and in designing of erosion control measures. {\textcopyright} SGEM2013 All Rights Reserved by the International Multidisciplinary Scientific GeoConference SGEM.},

abstract = {The importance of soil loss by water erosion becomes more eminent with the ongoing climate change, where more extreme precipitations in middle Europe are anticipated. The amount of soil transported from the field plot can substantially differ according to the intensity of rill erosion. The capability of mathematical models to predict appearance of extreme soil erosion spots on arable land (rills and gullies) are addressed in this paper. Three surface runoff$\backslash$erosion models were tested by comparing their outcomes with rills identified from orthophoto maps. Empirical methods are represented by Universal soil loss eq. (USLE). The equation is a simple method of the long term modeling of the sediment yield. Limitations of this method are in estimating soil loss from rainfall episodes and application of this equation in areas with concentrated flow is debatable. Second tool used is physically based model SMODERP which is being developed on CTU Prague since 1990s. Soil characteristics are based on Czech soil taxonomy system. The model SMODERP is excellent tool for modeling of sheet and concentrated surface runoff. Hydrological part of the model includes the processes of infiltration (Phillips equation), sheet surface runoff (Kinematic wave based equation), rill runoff, surface retention. Third tested modeling approach is based on Erosion-3D simulation model, developed at TU Freiberg (Germany). Erosion-3D is physically based and fully distributed rainfallrunoff model allowing calculation of transported sediment. The model can be run for single event, repeated events or sequence of events and the outputs include characteristics of runoff and soil transported in three particle size fractions. The soil input parameters are based on German standard of soil classification KA4. The uncertainties in inputs strongly influence the absolute values of soil erosion, but spatial distribution of netto erosion can be useful in identification of rill erosion appearance. The paper describes validation and application of models at the experimental field plot near Benesov (Central Bohemia, Czech Republic) in 2010. Airborne photographs of the field plot with apparent consequences of a heavy rainstorm event were used to visually derive the pattern of erosion rills and ephemeral gullies which were used for the main comparison. Standardized plots (22.1 m in length, 9 {\%} slope) for long term monitoring of erosion processes have been installed on this experimental field. Outflow from the plots and precipitation are automatically continuously measured during each natural rainfall event. The soil concentration in outflow and the volume of transported sediment is determined from samples in laboratory. Data from experimental plots can be used for validation of the model's input parameters.},

abstract = {Extensive land-use changes carried out during communist era still influence the landscape in Czech Republic. Soil loss by water erosion on arable land together with following sediment transport and its settling in the water system remains big issue. Various anti-erosion measures can decrease the amount of soil particles transported to the river-network and mitigate the water quality problems connected with sediment load. Process description and quantification are essential tools in soil-protection but computer modeling provides the power to quickly assess various areas and point out the endangered ones. $\backslash$nThe scope of soil-erosion modeling is very wide. For the purpose of legislation and urban planning the area of interest can cover an extent of thousands of square kilometers. On the other hand concrete anti-erosion measures design requires a scope of single farming blocks or small watersheds. $\backslash$nThe Department of Drainage, Irrigation and Landscape Engineering performs an ongoing research in soil erosion and transport modeling in various scales and their applicability. Empirical model WaTEM/SEDEM is being used for large areas modeling covering tens of thousands of square km. That serves mainly for trouble-spots localization and sediment-transport related tasks. Extensive application of WaTEM/SEDEM model covering about 40{\%} of the extent of the Czech Republic was carried out for project NAAR project No. QI102A265 “Assessment of soil erosion and phosphorus loads causing eutrophication of stagnant water bodies”. This project included soil-loss modeling, modeling of sediment and phosphorus transport in river-network and settlement in the important water reservoirs. $\backslash$nPhysically based models on the other hand enable detailed modeling of the processes, which can be used for practical design of the protection measures. Fully distributed model Erosion 3D is being used widely on the department. This software was tested on the field-block level to assess the impact of the precise farming on the soil properties as well as on a middle-sized watershed level to evaluate technical soil erosion control measures efficiency and soil-erosion off-site effects. $\backslash$nSMODERP is physically based computer model, which is being developed in the department since 1990s. Current version of this software is profile-based (1D) and provides tools to assess the soil-erosion a single slope profile. 2D version of SMODERP allowing modeling of sheet and concentrated surface flow is currently being tested and may be released in 2013.$\backslash$nThe paper describes applications of mentioned models, their potential and limitations and the overlay in their use and scopes. Soil erosion problem in Czech Republic is discussed as well as the availability of needed input data for the models.},

abstract = {A plenty of models exist for study of the soil erosion and sediment yield processes. However, these models vary significantly in terms of their capability and complexity, input requirements, representation of processes, spatial and temporal scale accountability, practical applicability, and types of output they provide. The present study reviews 50 physically based soil erosion and sediment yield models with respect to these factors including shortcomings and strengths. The literature generally suggests the use of models like SWAT, WEPP, AGNPS, ANSWERS and SHETRAN for soil erosion and sediment studies. Most of the developed soil erosion and sediment yield models are capable of simulating soil detachment and sediment delivery processes at hillslope scale; a limited development was found in the field of reservoir siltation and channel erosion processes. The study proposes a guideline for selection of an appropriate model to the reader for a given application or case study. The future research suggested to improve the simulation and prediction capability of physically based soil erosion and sediment yield models, and should focus on incorporation of improved global web based weather database, inclusion of sediment associated water quality and gully erosion simulation module, and improvement in reservoir siltation and channel erosion simulation processes.},

A simple interrill soil water transport model is applied to a laboratory catchment to investigate the application of raindrop detachment and transport in interrill areas explicitly. A controlled laboratory rainfall simulation study with slope length simulation by flow addition was used to assess the raindrop detachment and transport of detached soil by overland flow in interrill areas. Artificial rainfall of moderate to high intensity was used to simulate intense rain storms. However, experiments were restricted to conditions where rilling and channelling did not occur and where overland flow covered most of the surface. A simple equation with a rainfall intensity term for raindrop detachment, and a simple sediment transport equation with unit discharge and a slope term were found to be applicable to the situation where clear water is added at the upper end of a small plot to simulate increased slope length. The proposed generic relationships can be used to predict raindrop detachment and the sediment transport capacity of interrill flow and can therefore contribute to the development of physically-based erosion models.

abstract = {Catchment resources, generated from multi-source data (remotely-sensed, map- and ground-based systems), were input to a raster-based Geographical Information Systems (GIS) after geometrically co-registered to a standard grid (pixel). The GIS used was the PC-based, indigenously-developed package, called GRAM (Geo-Referenced Area Management). A set of knowledge-based rules, for assessing the soil erosion of this heterogeneous hilly catchment, were formulated from the knowledge of the multi-disciplinary resource-experts and the knowledge of the local catchment resources, in addition to the field observations. This rule-based model, which is hopefully fast and cost-effective and without effect of the individual bias, helped in inferring the erosion intensity units that most likely to occur at any given pixel in the system. Finally, the catchment was grouped into four different erosion intensity units namely very severe, severe, moderate to severe and slight to moderate. The quantitative soil loss (t ha-1 year-1) ranges, estimated by USLE model by a spatial information analysis approach (GIS), were also computed: (a) Very severe ({\textgreater} 50): (b) Severe (40-50); (c) Moderate to severe (20-40); and (d) Slight to moderate ({\textless} 20). An integrated priority delineation survey, for taking up soil/water conservation measures by Sediment Yield Index model, carried out in the catchment grouped the catchment into very high, high, medium and low priority classes. Apparently, the areal extent of high and moderate priority classes occupy about 80{\%} of the catchment, which is closely following the areal extent of severe and moderate to severe erosion intensity unit categories by this rule-based model. The outcome of the results of this study will be immensely useful to monitor the dynamic changes in the catchment environment. The soil erosion information system thus generated, identifies the targeted problem areas for conservation planning and sustainable development of the catchment. Although it is an early airing of results obtained from this rule-based model, the introduction of multi-disciplinary expert's informed opinion may provide an extension to the traditional methods of assessing the soil erosion status/magnitude which should enable and/or evaluate different catchment management scenarios.},

abstract = {Predictions from hydrologic and erosion models contain a large degree of uncertainty. The Modified Point Estimate Method (Harr, 1989) used in conjunction with a response surface exploration technique (Brooks, 1958) provides a simple, computationally efficient, and powerful tool for evaluating uncertainty of predictions by natural-resource models. The method allows analysis of models with a large number of input parameters which may be correlated and for which the exact input parameter distribution is unknown. The method was applied to the Water Erosion Prediction Project single rainfall-event erosion model. Sixty treatment combinations were selected to determine WEPP output uncertainties for a wide range of soil, crop, management, topographic, and storm conditions. The levels of the treatment combinations were randomly selected to span the entire factorial space of the 28 WEPP inputs, but with a finite number of treatment combinations. Five WEPP outputs were studied: peak runoff rate, average soil loss, average deposition, sediment yield, and sediment specific surface enrichment ratio. Maximum and average output uncertainties, given by the coefficient of variation, were determined for each output of the 60 treatments. Maximum coefficients of variation for peak runoff rate, soil loss, sediment yield, and sediment enrichment ratio were 196, 267, 323, and 47{\%}, respectively. Average coefficients of variation for the same set of variables were 65, 99, 106, and 13{\%}, respectively. Coefficient of variation was less for larger runoff and erosion events, which account for a large percentage of the total soil loss at a location over extended time periods. Significant, positive correlations existed between the coefficients of variation of peak runoff average soil loss, and average soil loss and sediment yield, indicating that the uncertainty in average soil loss and in sediment yield may be directly related to the uncertainty in peak runoff rate.},

abstract = {The specific parameters of soil erosion models as resistance to erosion, hydraulic roughness etc., are usually determined by simulated rainfall experiments. Due to the required plot length of usually 22. m, these experiments can only be carried out with an enormous effort of time and manpower. This study presents a runoff feeding device, which is able to multiply the plot length virtually by supplying sediment loaded runoff from upstream. Thus it is possible to restrict the plot length to 3. m and nevertheless simulate flow conditions similar to those using standard plots. The described method has been already tested successfully under laboratory conditions (Parson et al., 1998; R{\"{o}}mkens et al., 2001; Schmidt, 1996). In the present study, this method is used to determine input parameters for the soil loss and deposition model EROSION 2D/3D under field conditions. Based on the model parameters "skinfactor, soil resistance to erosion and surface roughness" the experimental approach is described exemplarily.

abstract = {Soil erosion models have advanced in recent years, by becoming more physically-based, with better representation of spatial patterns. Despite substantial progress, fundamental difficulties in catchment scale applications have been widely reported. In this paper, we introduce a new catchment scale soil erosion model. The model is designed for catchment interface and management purposes by: (1) using relatively common input data; (2) having a modular model structure; and (3) a clear and easily interpretable output analysis, by producing possibility or potential, rather than quantitative erosion maps. The model (named: FuDSEM; fuzzy-based dynamic soil erosion model) is spatially explicit and temporally dynamic and is formalized and based on fuzzy-logic equations. FuDSEM was initially evaluated on a small data-rich catchment and was found well calibrated. It was then implemented on a medium-sized heterogeneous catchment in central Israel. Initial evaluations of the medium-scale model predictions were conducted by: (1) comparison of FuDSEM runoff predictions against measured runoff from five hydrological stations and (2) a site specific evaluation of the FuDSEM multi-year erosion prediction in two sub-catchments. FuDSEM was compared with two other erosion models (a temporally static version of itself and a known physically-based model). The results show the advantages of FuDSEM over the other two models in evaluating the relative distribution of erosion, thereby emphasizing the benefits of its temporally dynamic and fuzzy structure. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The erosive power of frequent light rainfalls is studied in this paper. Field experiments of simulated rainfall (Intensity, 21 mm h(-1) and kinetic energy, 13.5 J m(-2) mm(-1)) were conducted over 8 bounded USLE plots (80 m(2) each) with a slope of 10{\%}. In 4 plots the soil was almost bare ({\textless}4{\%} vegetation cover); the other 4 plots had almost full cover with natural vegetation in one year. Runoff and sediment yield was recorded. The results revealed the efficiency of vegetation cover reducing runoff and sediments. Runoff and sediments were negligible in covered plots. Therefore, in bare plots, although sediment yield was generally low, averaging 74+/-43 kg ha(-1), the mean of runoff achieved a coefficient of 35{\%}, this magnitude has to be taken into consideration in this region verging on aridity. Rains around 13.5 J m(-2) mm(-1) of kinetic energy are quite frequent in the study area (34{\%} of recorded rains en 12 years). If we would consider the usual lower limits from the literature, we would be ignoring an important percent of natural rainfall episodes.},

abstract = {Knowledge of erosion rates under real conditions is of great concern regarding sustainability of landuse and off-site effects on water bodies and settlements. Experimentally derived rates of sheet and rill erosion are often biased by experimental settings, which deviate considerably from typical landuse, by short measuring periods and by small spatial extensions, which do not account for the pronounced spatio-temporal variability of erosion events. We compiled data from 27 studies covering 1076 plot years to account for this variability. Modelling was used to correct for deficiencies in the experimental settings, which overrepresented arable land and used steeper and shorter slopes as well as higher erosivity than typically found in reality. For example, the average slope gradient was 5.9° for all arable plot experiments while it is only 2.6° on total arable land in Germany. The expected soil loss by sheet and rill erosion in Germany after taking real slopes, landuse and erosivity into account averaged 2.7 t ha−1 yr−1. Annual crops contributed the largest proportion (90{\%}) but hops despite its negligible contribution to landuse (0.06{\%}) still contribute 1.0{\%} due to its extraordinary rapid erosion, which was even faster than the measured bare fallow soil loss standardized to otherwise identical conditions. Bare fallow soil loss, which is often used as baseline, was 80 t ha−1 yr−1 when standardized to 5.1° slope gradient, 200 m flow path length, and average German erosivity.},

abstract = {Water erosion is a very dynamic process with direct and indirect consequences on ecosystem functioning. While the processes of sediment (SED) and soil organic carbon (SOC) detachment and transport are well recognized, it is however difficult to assess and interpret their impact on SED and SOC detachment, transport and sedimentation within a given landscape. In this study of a tropical area of the Mekong Basin, our main objective was to evaluate sediment (SED), soil organic carbon (SOC) and runoff (R) delivery from various spatial scales from 1m² to 10km² and to interpret these results in term of erosion processes operating within the landscape. Deliveries from nested scales of microplots (1×1m²; n=12 installed at different topographic positions and soils of a hillslope), plots (1×2.5m²; n=8), hillslope (60×100m²) and catchment (30, 60, and 1000ha) were assessed during an entire rainy season. To improve understanding of soil erosion at landscape level, delivery of mobilized water, sediment and SOC from one surface area to the following one in the nested experimental design were confronted to environmental information on rainfall characteristics (rainfall intensity, I; maximum 6-min rainfall intensity, Imax; rainfall amount, R; rainfall depth Dur; cumulative yearly rainfall prior to the event, Cum), slope gradient (S), soil thickness (T) and soil crusting (Crust), antecedent soil water content (SWC), and depth to the water table (DWT). These data were finally compared to extensive mapping of the thickness and the type of the soils in an attempt to validate these results and to evaluate the longer term consequences of erosion processes on soil distribution. The mean sediment delivery from 1×1m² plots was 899gm−2y−1 with standard error (SE) of 26gm−2y−1. The SED delivery decreased to 275±63gm−2y−1 on 1×2.5m2 plots and to 4.3gm−2y−1 at the hillslope level but then increased to 16.6gm−2y−1 at the basin level. The slight decrease in SED delivery flux from 899gm−1y−1 on 1m long plots to 688±157gm−1y−1 on 2.5m2 long plots and to 468gm−1y−1 on the 100m long hillslope revealed that SED detachment and transport in slopes is mainly controlled by splash. The ratio of plot to microplot deliveries for R increased significantly as Crust increased (r=0.91) but decreased with increasing Cov (r=−0.88) while the ratio for SOC correlated the most with S (r=0.97) and Cov (r=−0.58). The R delivery ratio from hillslope to plot and from river to hillslope increased as soils get wetter and the water table rose while higher ratios for SED and SOC occurred at longer event duration and larger rainfall depth amount and at larger yearly antecedent rainfall in the case of the within catchment delivery. The large accumulations of SED and SOC at the lower parts of hillslopes confirms the observed erosion dynamics longer-term, (i.e., removal and transport of SED and SOC mainly by splash because of high infiltration occurring in slopes) thus suggesting a potential long-term sequestration of the SOC deposited in the lower parts of hillslopes while deposition in the river network appeared ephemeral.},

@article{Cerdan2010,
abstract = {An extensive database of short to medium-term erosion rates as measured on erosion plots in Europe under natural rainfall was compiled from the literature. Statistical analysis confirmed the dominant influence of land use and cover on soil erosion rates. Sheet and rill erosion rates are highest on bare soil; vineyards show the second highest soil losses, followed by other arable lands (spring crops, orchards and winter crops). A land with a permanent vegetation cover (shrubs, grassland and forest) is characterised by soil losses which are generally more than an order of magnitude lower than those on arable land. Disturbance of permanent vegetation by fire leads to momentarily higher erosion rates but rates are still lower than those measured on arable land. We also noticed important regional differences in erosion rates. Erosion rates are generally much lower in the Mediterranean as compared to other areas in Europe; this is mainly attributed to the high soil stoniness in the Mediterranean. Measured erosion rates on arable and bare land were related to topography (slope steepness and length) and soil texture, while this was not the case for plots with a permanent land cover. We attribute this to a fundamental difference in runoff generation and sediment transfer according to land cover types. On the basis of these results we calculated mean sheet and rill erosion rates for the European area covered by the CORINE database: estimated rill and interrill erosion rates are ca. 1.2tha−1year−1 for the whole CORINE area and ca. 3.6tha−1year−1 for arable land. These estimates are much lower than some earlier estimates which were based on the erroneous extrapolation of small datasets. High erosion rates occur in areas dominated by vineyards, the hilly loess areas in West and Central Europe and the agricultural areas located in the piedmont areas of the major European mountain ranges.},

abstract = {The use of legacy data in international soil mapping projects entails the demand for the harmonisation of soil data. Accurate correlation between national and international soil classification units is an important prerequisite in global soil mapping and acquisition of harmonised soil data usable in environmental applications. The correlation of soil units at different taxonomic levels was undertaken to relate the Czech national soil classification system with the World Reference Base (WRB) and evaluate the effectiveness of a semantic approach (analogical soil units provided by expert knowledge), and quantitative approach in the correlation. For the quantitave approach, a set of 433 soil profiles randomly selected from the Large-scale mapping of agricultural soils in Czechoslovakia was classified according to WRB using available analytical and morphological soil data. The study showed the necessity for an analytical approach and quantitative data use for reliable correlation between the two classification schemes. The general level of correlability at the higher taxonomic level can be considered as high (88{\{}{\%}{\}}), whilst there is a significant variability of correlation accuracy between soil types. Conversion of some soil units, e.g. Rankers, Rendzinas, Pararendzinas, {\{}{\v{C}}{\}}ernice, {\{}{\v{C}}{\}}ernozems, Podzols or Luvizems requires analytical and morphological data of corresponding profiles. Relatively low correlability is caused by various factors. Different concepts of the soil unit and different setting of the criteria of the diagnostic soil properties are the most important. Some units such as Glejs, Fluvizems or Hn{\{}{\v{e}}{\}}dozems can be correlated with a high probability of accurate assignment. High incompatibility was shown at the lower taxonomic level. Correlation of lower taxonomic units should be subject to analytical processing.},

abstract = {High Andean paramo and cloud forest ecosystems in South America are undergoing transition to agricultural activities such as potato farming and cattle grazing in many areas. There is a lack of data quantifying the contributions of these land uses to soil erosion and nutrients loss. Thus, we assessed soil quality in patches of potato crops and pasture for cattle grazing, and tested soil and nutrient loss from these two land uses in response to heavy rainfall simulation rates (100mmh−1). Physico-chemical analyses were also carried out in soil and runoff water samples. We found that potato farming had more severe impacts on soil quality, with substantial loss of the silt fraction (low silt levels of 11.9{\%} were found in soil composition) that prevents aggregates formation and increase soil instability. Furthermore, we found that potato farming resulted in much higher soil loss rate (5.67gh−1) compared to that of pastoral land use (0.61gh−1). Meanwhile, N and P average losses measured in runoff were 1.22mg N-NO3 l−1 plus 0.12mg P-PO3 l−1 for the potato crop, and 0.86mg N-NO3 l−1 plus 0.09mg P-PO3 l−1 for the pastures, respectively. We postulate that more effective and continuous rooting prevents soil disaggregation in pasture relative to cropping, and that continuous and extensive foliage protects the soil from rain-splash erosion. Finally, direct relationships appeared between the two agricultural practices evaluated and the loss of soil and nutrients. Thus, if anthropogenic practices such as those studied herein continue their widespread trend observed in recent years in the region, then two of the most important paramo eco-systemic services, that is, water regulation and high water quality supply, may be impaired with all the consequences this brings for human settlements and their livelihoods located down waters.},

abstract = {a b s t r a c t Small-scale portable rainfall simulators are an essential research tool for investigating the process dynamics of soil erosion and surface hydrology. There is no standardisation of rainfall simulation and such rainfall simula-tors differ in design, rainfall intensities, rain spectra and research questions, which impede drawing a meaningful comparison between results. Nevertheless, these data become progressively important for soil erosion assess-ment and therefore, the basis for decision-makers in application-oriented erosion protection. The artificially generated rainfall of the simulators used at the Universities Basel, La Rioja, Malaga, Trier, T{\"{u}}bingen, Valencia, Wageningen, Zaragoza, and at different CSIC (Spanish Scientific Research Council) insti-tutes (Almeria, Cordoba, Granada, Murcia and Zaragoza) was measured with the same methods (Laser Pre-cipitation Monitor for drop spectra and rain collectors for spatial distribution). Data are very beneficial for improvements of simulators and comparison of simulators and results. Furthermore, they can be used for comparative studies, e.g. with measured natural rainfall spectra. A broad range of rainfall data was measured (e.g. intensity: 37–360 mm h −1 ; Christiansen Coefficient for spatial rainfall distribution: 61–98{\%}; median volumetric drop diameter: 0.375–6.5 mm; mean kinetic energy expenditure: 25–1322 J m −2 h −1 ; mean kinetic energy per unit area and unit depth of rainfall: 0.77–50 J m −2 mm −1). Similarities among the simulators could be found e.g. concerning drop size distributions (maximum drop numbers are reached within the smallest drop classes b1 mm) and low fall velocities of bigger drops due to a general physical restriction. The comparison represents a good data-base for improvements and provides a consistent picture of the different parameters of the simulators that were tested.},

abstract = {Because of wind erosion during the dust bowl era of the early 1930s in the central United States, Congress appropriated federal funding to study the problem and find ways that protect the land from all forms of erosion. Afterwards, a series of erosion stations were established across the eastern United States, and natural rainfall‐runoff plots were placed on a wide range of soils, slopes, and cropping/management systems. The data collected from these studies served as the basis for developing the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) for rain‐induced erosion which is still, in its revised form, the basis for determining " highly erodible lands " for various USDA programs. Because of the expense of maintaining USLE plots, and the extreme variability in the research data, they were discontinued, and most research since the 1950s in water erosion has focused on using rainfall simulators to quantify differences in erosion from all the variables of the USLE, and refining other parameters, such as factors K and C. The simulators used over the last 60 years have varied widely in design and functionality, but paid little or no attention to the type of water used to conduct the simulation. The objective of this article is to describe relevant advances in the historical development of simulator technology in the United States and describe principal design improvements that allow them to be used in a wider range of rainfall‐runoff and erosion studies. This article will also describe the most recent portable simulator developed at the National Soil Erosion Research Laboratory.},

@article{Siepel2002,
abstract = {Soil and water conservation practices are increasingly being considered for curbing non-point source pollution from agricultural land. Several studies have demonstrated that stream power is a simple and good predictor of soil detachment and transport and can be used to predict the effect of soil and water conservation practices on soil loss. Our objective was, therefore, to develop a simple water erosion simulation model that is physically based on stream power, handles vegetation in terms of contact cover, and considers the settling velocity characteristics of the eroding sediment. The model assumes that rill flow can occur on hillslope segments with net erosion, but on segments with net deposition sheet flow is assumed. Input parameters include the depositability of the soil, rill shape, rill density, net precipitation, and an empirical power function describing the decrease of sediment concentration with vegetative cover increase. The model was evaluated by comparison of predicted and observed relationships between sediment concentration, slope, and vegetative residue cover in two experimental studies using simulated rainfall: one that involved erosion plots with various uniform slopes and levels of vegetative cover, and another that involved the observation of soil movement on mechanically shaped concave, uniform, and convex slopes with negligible vegetation. Without calibration, the model appeared to represent soil erosion relationships observed in these studies and is simple enough to be included in grid-based variable source hydrology models.},

@article{Seibert,
abstract = {[1] Gridded digital elevation data, often referred to as DEMs, are one of the most widely available forms of environmental data. Topographic analysis of DEMs can take many forms, but in hydrologic and geomorphologic applications it is typically used as a surrogate for the spatial variation of hydrological conditions (topographic indices) and flow routing. Here we report on a new flow routing algorithm and compare it to three common classes of algorithms currently in widespread use. The advantage of the new algorithm is that unrealistic dispersion on planar or concave hillslopes is avoided, whereas multiple flow directions are allowed on convex hillslopes. We suggest that this new triangular multiple flow direction algorithm (MD1) is more appropriate for a range of flow routing and topographic index applications. Citation: Seibert, J., and B. L.
